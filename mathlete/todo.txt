Layout 

Activities - 1)Main menu, 2)settings, 3)activity for each chapter with subactivities for each type of exercise.

1) Main menu, List of exercises, with color-coding for status of completion of activities. Maybe better pictorial 
   representation of completed activities.
2) Settings, difficulty, time, reset.
3) Countdown timer/bar that slows down accordingly when user begins inputting answer. Why? Need to account for 
   time needed to enter answer.
   

Other
1) Generating random numbers
2) Creating countdown timer/bar.
3) Database for storing status of exercises (Which one's completed).
4) How should I organize the exercises (i.e. OOP/Class design).
